  # Thoropass Vulnerability Research Program
  
  🔐 **Security Research • CVE Discovery • Responsible Disclosure** 🧪
  
</div>







The **Thoropass Vulnerability Research Program** initiative documents original security research conducted by Thoropass pentesters, focused on identifying, validating, and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities in widely used software and open-source projects.

This repository serves as a **public archive of advisories and CVE-related research**, contributing to the broader security community and improving ecosystem resilience.

## 🔬 Research Focus

Our research efforts concentrate on:

- Original vulnerability discovery
- Root-cause analysis of security flaws
- High-impact, reproducible findings
- Coordinated vulnerability disclosure
- Publication of security advisories and CVEs

Research is conducted ethically, safely, and in alignment with industry best practices.

## 🧾 Advisories & CVEs

All public findings are documented as security advisories, including:

- Vulnerability description
- Affected components and versions
- Security impact
- Mitigation and remediation guidance
- CVE identifiers 
- ---


## 🏷️ What is a CVE?

A **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** identifier is a globally recognized reference for a specific security vulnerability.

CVE identifiers:
- Enable consistent tracking across tools and vendors
- Link vulnerabilities to patches, mitigations, and CVSS scores
- Improve transparency and accountability in security disclosure

Not all advisories receive a CVE immediately; publication depends on coordination with maintainers and CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs).

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

Thoropass follows **coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD)** principles:

- Vulnerabilities are reported privately to maintainers or CNAs
- Reasonable time is provided for remediation
- Public advisories are released after coordination or fix availability

We do not publish:
- Customer data
- Sensitive secrets or credentials
- Exploit code intended for mass abuse
- ---
- ## 🌍 Ecosystem Contribution

Our research contributes to:

- Open-source security improvement
- Vendor remediation efforts
- CVE databases and advisory feeds
- Security tooling and risk intelligence platforms

Where applicable, vulnerabilities are disclosed through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Vendor security programs
- Recognized CNAs (e.g. VulnDB)

## 🧠 Research Credits

Research published here is conducted by **Thoropass Pentest Team** and contributors.

Individual researchers are credited in each advisory.
